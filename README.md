# DESTINO
It is a FPS shooter game. The objective of the game is to collect cookies and eliminate 
all the enemies. We can change between weapons and we can explore the game world too. 
The game world is basically set on a different planet and there is Lava and rocks everywhere. 
The player is on a ground which is safe but not completely as there are killer bots in every room. In order to survive we need to kill them. 
There are different types of enemies Big turt bot and small turt bots which dealt different damages. there is Jet pack also which will help you to explore and move around.
i have built this game using Unity 3d and Microsoft visual studio. 
After the campaign is over i would like to make more levels which increasing difficulties and different buildings/structures, props to make it more interesting. 
i am gonna include the scripts which i have used in making this game. i hope you guys can make one too using these. 
best of luck!!!
